    "description": "A binary search can be used to quickly find a specific mod causing trouble, which can be especially useful when logs don't give a conclusive answer to your issue.\n\nStart by removing or disabling half of your mods, then test if the problem still occurs. If it does, remove half of the remaining mods and test again. If it doesn't, add back half of the mods you just removed.\n\nKeep in mind you don't have to stick strictly to halves each time, and may have to enable some library mods like Fabric API out of order.\n\nBy repeating this on an increasingly smaller set of mods, you'll find the problematic mod within a few iterations.",
